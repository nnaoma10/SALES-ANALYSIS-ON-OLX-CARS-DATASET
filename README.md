# SALES-ANALYSIS-ON-OLX-CARS-DATASET

## Project overview
DRIVEN BY DATA: WHAT OLX TELLS US ABOUT USED CARS

INTRODUCTION:
In today’s digital age, the traditional ways of buying and selling automobiles have been significantly transformed by online platforms. OLX, as one of the leading online marketplaces for used cars, offers a rich repository of data that reflects emerging market trends, consumers behaviors, and pricing patterns. Motivated by the rapid evolution of digital commerce and its impact on the used car sector, I embarked on this project to explore and analyze the OLX cars dataset.
This project aims to unravel underlying patterns in the online used car market, such as price variability, regional differences, and the influence of various car attributes on sale outcomes. By conducting a detailed data analysis, the research seeks to provide valuable insights that can aid buyers, sellers, and market analysts in making informed decisions. Additionally, this background study leverages advanced analytical techniques to predict trends and highlight opportunities, thus contributing to the broader discussion on how data-driven insights can redefine market strategies in the digital economy.
Overall, the project not only enhances our understanding of the dynamics within the OLX car listings but also serves as a case study for applying statistical and machine learning methodologies to real-world datasets.

## Objective
EXPLORATION AND DATA CLEANING: To understand the structure, quality, and scope of the OLX cars dataset.
•	Identify key features such as price, brand, model, mileage, year, and location.
•	Handle missing or inconsistent data entries to ensure accuracy and consistency.
•	Provide recommendations on pricing strategies, inventory management, and consumer targeting based on your analysis.

## Description
: This dataset comprises several key variables that provide insights into the vehicles listed, the seller details, and market specific attributes.

1.	VEHICLE ATTRIBUTES
•	Price
DEF: The listed selling price of the vehicle. It is in Numerical(continuous).
It is used to analyze market price trends, average cost, and regional pricing differences.

•	Brand/Make:
DEF: The manufacturer of the car. Examples: Toyota, BMW, HYUNDAI, FORD)

•	Model:
DEF: This is the specific model of the car. Example, Corolla, Mustang etc)

•	Year
DEF: The year in which the car was manufactured. It is in Numerical or year format. 

•	Mileage
DEF: This implies the total distance the car has traveled. It is also in Numerical.

•	Fuel Type
Def: The type of fuel the vehicle uses (eg: petrol, diesel, electric, hybrid). It is in categorical or text format.

•	Location
DEF: This means the geographical information about where the vehicle is being sold. It could be at the city, region or country level.

##  Data cleaning and Preparation
DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION: Transforming and cleaning your data is a crucial step in any data analysis project. There are well structured steps involved in cleaning and transforming the OLX cars dataset.
•	Data Importation
•	Handling missing values
•	Removing duplicates
•	Trim
•	Standardizing formats using Lower-upper-proper
•	Detection of Outlier
•	Data Type conversion
•	Recheck your data.

## Tools
•	Excel – Data cleaning
•	SQL – Data Analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis answers important questions in the OLX Cars dataset that helps uncover insights and guide decision – making.
It answers the question of the overall structure of the dataset like;
•	How many rows and columns are in the dataset?
•	Whether there are duplicates or missing values?
•	Which model appear most frequently?
•	How does mileage affect car price?
•	What is the distribution of fuel type and transmission?
•	Which location has the most sales?

## Results & Findings

After conducting my exploratory data analysis and data cleaning on the OLX Cars dataset, the following key insights and findings were discovered:

## Conclusion:
The analysis of the OLX Cars dataset has provided valuable insights into the behavior and structure of the used car market. From the trends in pricing to the influence of factors such as brand, mileage, fuel type and location, the data reflects a competitive and dynamic marketplace.

Key conclusions include:
Toyota, Honda and Suzuki are most of the brands that made more revenue and are commonly preferred.
Price is strongly influenced by mileage and brand.
Automatic and petrol – powered cars are more popular, reflecting buyers preferences.
OLX appears to be a critical platform for connecting buyers and sellers in second – hand car market.

## Recommendation:
Based on my findings, the following recommendations are proposed:

For Buyers:

•	Focus on vehicles with reasonable mileage and good service history, especially from trusted brands like Toyota and Honda.
•	Always compare similar models and years to avoid overpaying.

For Sellers:

•	Clearly highlight features like low mileage, fuel efficiency and type, and service records to attract buyers.
•	Set realistic and competitive prices based on model, condition, and market trends.
•	Include detailed and clean data (especially accurate year and mileage) to improve buyer trust.•	Introduce filters and tags for key features like “verified seller”, “Low Mileage”, to enhance searchability.
•	Consider building a price suggestion tool that guides sellers based on historical data.



## Limitations:
•	Incomplete Data:  Some data lacked some key information such as year of manufacture.
•	Lack of Contextual Data: Important factors such as accident history, number of owners, car condition or service history are not included, which limits a full evaluation of pricing and value.
